<p> These are some of the simple operational functions of the website. Most inputs return a digitized image alongside text. This makes for easy browsing. </p> 

<h2>Neilsen's Heuristics</h2>

   <ol type="I">
      <li><u>Visibility of System Status</u>: The system status updates are inconsistent. There were multiple points where the page took over a minute to load with no communication from the system.</li>
      <li><u>Match Between system and the Real World</u>:The system handles this well. There were no real challenge in understanding what was needed to proceed and everything was presented in a concise and understandable way.</li>
      <li><u>User Control and Freedom</u>: The user control was poor. The back button is supported by the system and allows a one way escape from a page, but the home button removes the user from The Tower specific page making for a frustrating interaction with the system.</li>
      <li><u>Consistency and Standards</u>: There was good consistency in this system. There were no surprises about how to operate the system.</li>
      <li><u>Error Prevention</u>: I did not encounter any error messages while using the system. Therefore, the system seems to have a good process for error prevention or at least can handle those slip errors well. There were some question marks on pages that did not load the documents, but the pages themselves did not present any error messages.</li>
      <li><u>Recognition over Recall</u>: The system provides a chain of where you had been and where you are now at the top of the page. That allows for the user to understand what actions they have taken, and what to select to get back to where they were. The home button is the one inconsistency with this system, and that does make for some confusion.</li>

      <li><u>Flexibility and Efficiency of Use</u>: There were no noticeable shortcuts in the system, but I would consider myself a novice when it comes to systems interactions and therefore they may have successfully hidden those from me.</li>
      <li><u>Aesthetic and Minimalist Design</u>: The aesthetic of the system is plain. It is not overly busy and allows for easy exploration, but it is by no means pretty to look at. </li>
      <li><u>Recognize, Diagnose, and Recover from Errors</u>: I did not see any error messages delivered in a pop-up or any other style. There were times where I saw a document with a question mark in the center. This was an unhelpful error to see and the only solution was to use the back arrow or reload the page. This is not user friendly. </li>
      <img src="Screen Shot 2024-11-13 at 11.53.31 AM.png" alt="Page not loading" width="700" height="400">
      <li><u>Help and Documentation</u>: There is no help documentation present. There is no help icon or other listed documents to help users with questions. Adding those would be incredibly helpful. </li>
   </ol>  

<h2>Strengths and Weaknesses Table</h2>
<table style-"width:100%">
  <tr>
    <th>Strengths</th>
    <th>Weaknesses</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Strength 1: The function of the system is good. There are no confusing words and the search functions along with general browsing of the collection is easy to understand.</td>
    <td>Weakness 1: The speed of the processing was very slow. This made for a lot of frustrating moments waiting for documents to populate. When scrolling down in a specific newspaper edition you have to wait for it to load again. That does not make the user want to stay on the website.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Strength 2: The search bar is a great tool. It is incredibly helpful that a user can search the collection by keyword and find multiple search results containing the word as well as those key words being highlighted within the document.</td>
    <td>Weakness 2: The system being hosted within the Special Collections website also means that it is easy for a user to hit the home button and be taken away from The Tower archives. I find that frustrating and it made my experience using the website even more annoying when I had to backtrack manually or select from the chain of processes I had taken.</td>
  </tr>

<h2><u>Final Thoughts</u></h2>

<h4>Comparisons</h4>
<p> The mini-usability test provided similar challenges with the system that I had identified. Overall, my participant was incredibly frustrated with the experience on the system, and had a negative outlook on the system. At multiple points in the test, they expressed a desire to leave the archives website and instead go to Google to search there for information instead. Additionally, they discovered and used a function that I had not utilized: the text view function. With the test view they were hoping to bypass slow loading time, a problem I also encountered, but it provided very little help. They found the text hard to read and often misspelled or altogether incorrect grammar-wise.</p>
<p> Additionally, they never discovered the pages tab where a user can download the specific page they want to view, and I believe that is because the design is so flat the tab blends into the other options on the page. They were unable to really read anything on the system because of slow loading times and bad resolution, and therefore would never use the system again. I found similar frustration with the loading that I circumvented by downloading documents, but that does not mean that the usability is easy.</p>

<h4> Suggestions</h4>
 
<ul>
  <li>I think adding some better design to the system would make for a more pleasant experience that would allow all kinds of people to want to utilize the system for research or exploration. Adding better contrast to allow for more of a streamlined process for finding different useful tabs would be great.</li>
  <li>I think adding a link or pass way through to the current The Tower page would be a great way to encourage users to explore both of these systems and see truly how much has changed. </li>
  <li>Finding a way to speed up processing times would be incredible. That was clearly the most frustrating element of the system. Fixing that alone would encourage more use of the system. </li>
</ul>
